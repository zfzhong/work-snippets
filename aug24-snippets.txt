- Olympic games is a big event, and Chinese people care olympics games
very much (bacause the gov/media spent a lot of resource on
it). Therefore, this kind of event (once every 4 years) can be
exploited to get internet traffics. For example, some simple
statistics about the olympics swimmers would get a lot of attention:
list all medal receivers (year/country/past/current position) and also
the ones who got caught for doping and got banned. Making a good page
to circulate on internet, either positive or negative info about it
(make sure it's imple fact) would cause a lot of attention. Because
the a lot of information was hidden from the chinese people, and
anything that is informative might got attention. The website can be:

- Two pixel watches need to be 'disconnect & reset' before them can be
paired with samsung galaxy phone using the Google Pixel Watch app on
the phone. On the phone, we open the internal testing link and can
install the Slogger App on the watches.

- If we want to install the Slogger on multiple pixel watches that are
  linked to a single phone (with a single google account), you can log
  into the google play store via web and install the Slogger on each
  watch (click the 'Install on more devices' button):
