- Olympic games is a big event, and Chinese people care olympics games
very much (bacause the gov/media spent a lot of resource on
it). Therefore, this kind of event (once every 4 years) can be
exploited to get internet traffics. For example, some simple
statistics about the olympics swimmers would get a lot of attention:
list all medal receivers (year/country/past/current position) and also
the ones who got caught for doping and got banned. Making a good page
to circulate on internet, either positive or negative info about it
(make sure it's imple fact) would cause a lot of attention. Because
the a lot of information was hidden from the chinese people, and
anything that is informative might got attention. The website can be:
