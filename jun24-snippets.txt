======
1. Paired withings watch with iphone (downloaded withings App).
2. Setup 'withings.geosketch.art/callback/' as the callback for
withings developer portal application.
3. Setup TOP to connect to hotspot (tether24g) at boot. My guess was
right: it can't connect to tether5g. Both TOP/FISH connect to tether5g
at boot.

======
1. Tested TOP device, the GPS data were sent to server successfully.
2. Need to work on a source-level-control mechanism.
3. Titon fixed FISH for me: switch, voltage converter, frame pillar.
4. Tested, USBLLONG messages were send to the server from TOP.
5. The GPS messages are too frequent, should not send to the server.
6. Created SourceLevel model in django on the AWS server. Now we need
to design how to change robotics' sourcelevel based on the sourcelevel
configured on the server.

06/06
======
1. Oauth2 done for withings. Need to use code to request access_token.
2. Request access_token done, and got user info via API.
3. Trouble shooting gunicorn: sudo systemctl status gunicorn`
4. Need to rename the project and check into github. I can rename it
as 'aws-server'. 

06/07
======
1. Renamed the aws project as 'serveraws' and checked code into github.

06/09
======
1. Built django models for withings project: userinfo, device, experiment.
2. Pulling heart/accel data from withings cloud not successful. Need
more tests. 
3. Finally got accel data successfully. Heart data still pending.

06/10
======
1. Got ECG working: listheart, getheart. It's need to approved before
we can pull the data.
2. Need to create a ecg table to store ecg information.

3. Need to work on adjusting sourceLevel according to the response
from server. A preliminary design:
a). When uploading data to the server, the TOP side should include its
current sourceLevel.
b) The server compare the TOP's current sourceLevel with the latest
record of the SourceLevel record on the server.
c) If the source levels are different, the server will include
server's sourceLevel to the response.
d) At the TOP side, when it receives a sourceLevel value from the
server, it sends a command message to the command topic.

Note: after the first command is sent, it takes a while for the TOP to
change its sourceLevel. In between, multiple sourceLevel values might
be sent to the TOP from the server. In this case, the TOP should
handle duplicated commands well.

06/11
======
1. Top source level control were done via the server + commander_control_node.
2. Lake test showing that controlling source level via server works
well. However, the RSSI didn't change even though the source level
were changed from 3 to 1. I thought once the Top changed it's source
level, the Fish should change it soon as well. We need to investigate:
how long does it take the Fish to change its source level following
the change of the Top.

3. We didnt put weight on the Fish. We should put weight on the Fish
so it will hold upright when we drop it into the water.

4. The top was crashed by probably a jet ski on the lake. The
electronics were damaged. We need to confirm that the USBL is working.
