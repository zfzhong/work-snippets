1. Paired withings watch with iphone (downloaded withings App).
2. Setup 'withings.geosketch.art/callback/' as the callback for
withings developer portal application.
3. Setup TOP to connect to hotspot (tether24g) at boot. My guess was
right: it can't connect to tether5g. Both TOP/FISH connect to tether5g
at boot.

4. Tested, USBLLONG messages were send to the server from TOP.
5. The GPS messages are too frequent, should not send to the server.

to design how to change robotics' sourcelevel based on the sourcelevel
configured on the server.
