1. Paired withings watch with iphone (downloaded withings App).
2. Setup 'withings.geosketch.art/callback/' as the callback for
withings developer portal application.
3. Setup TOP to connect to hotspot (tether24g) at boot. My guess was
right: it can't connect to tether5g. Both TOP/FISH connect to tether5g
at boot.

1. Tested TOP device, the GPS data were sent to server successfully.
2. Need to work on a source-level-control mechanism.
3. Titon fixed FISH for me: switch, voltage converter, frame pillar.
4. Tested, USBLLONG messages were send to the server from TOP.
5. The GPS messages are too frequent, should not send to the server.
6. Created SourceLevel model in django on the AWS server. Now we need
to design how to change robotics' sourcelevel based on the sourcelevel
configured on the server.
