1. Paired withings watch with iphone (downloaded withings App).
2. Setup 'withings.geosketch.art/callback/' as the callback for
withings developer portal application.
3. Setup TOP to connect to hotspot (tether24g) at boot. My guess was
right: it can't connect to tether5g. Both TOP/FISH connect to tether5g
at boot.
