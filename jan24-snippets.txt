1. Found some poker sites that might be useful:
- https://www.cardschat.com/poker/
- https://www.888poker.com/magazine/strategy/7-ways-using-poker-statistics

The first one even has a 30-day free training, which sounds interesting. I dont have time to study it now, obviously.

2. Read 3 chapers of the book "Practical Poker Math". Only simple math.

1. Not writing snippets for seveal days, coz I felt quite tired in the
last couple of days. 
2. Devloped about 5 models for AMC8 2023 problems. Sometimes it took
me several hours to finish one model, I then doubt AI can develop such
model intelligently. On another hand, maybe this is exactly the
opportunity for AI -- to develop model faster than humans.

1. Done most of the models for  AMC8 2023 problems. It's just too time
consuming to build the models one by one. Again, AI tools might be
able to extract the variables and components (square, line, angle,
etc), and I just need to connect these components and specify the
connection by writing a function for the connection. We might
introduce the 'input dimensions' which means the different sources of
input. These different inputs actually control the variation
scope. When AI identify a component, it also generates the code to
define that component. 

2. The key problems can AI abstract the math problems into a
fundamental data structure, for example, a directed graph (or other
structures).
