1. Found some poker sites that might be useful:
- https://www.cardschat.com/poker/
- https://www.888poker.com/magazine/strategy/7-ways-using-poker-statistics

The first one even has a 30-day free training, which sounds interesting. I dont have time to study it now, obviously.

2. Read 3 chapers of the book "Practical Poker Math". Only simple math.

1. Not writing snippets for seveal days, coz I felt quite tired in the
last couple of days. 
2. Devloped about 5 models for AMC8 2023 problems. Sometimes it took
me several hours to finish one model, I then doubt AI can develop such
model intelligently. On another hand, maybe this is exactly the
opportunity for AI -- to develop model faster than humans.
