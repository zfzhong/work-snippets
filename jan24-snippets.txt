========
1. Found some poker sites that might be useful:
- https://www.cardschat.com/poker/
- https://www.888poker.com/magazine/strategy/7-ways-using-poker-statistics

The first one even has a 30-day free training, which sounds interesting. I dont have time to study it now, obviously.

2. Read 3 chapers of the book "Practical Poker Math". Only simple math.
