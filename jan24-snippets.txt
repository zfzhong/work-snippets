1. Found some poker sites that might be useful:
- https://www.cardschat.com/poker/
- https://www.888poker.com/magazine/strategy/7-ways-using-poker-statistics

The first one even has a 30-day free training, which sounds interesting. I dont have time to study it now, obviously.

2. Read 3 chapers of the book "Practical Poker Math". Only simple math.

1. Not writing snippets for seveal days, coz I felt quite tired in the
last couple of days. 
2. Devloped about 5 models for AMC8 2023 problems. Sometimes it took
me several hours to finish one model, I then doubt AI can develop such
model intelligently. On another hand, maybe this is exactly the
opportunity for AI -- to develop model faster than humans.

1. Done most of the models for  AMC8 2023 problems. It's just too time
consuming to build the models one by one. Again, AI tools might be
able to extract the variables and components (square, line, angle,
etc), and I just need to connect these components and specify the
connection by writing a function for the connection. We might
introduce the 'input dimensions' which means the different sources of
input. These different inputs actually control the variation
scope. When AI identify a component, it also generates the code to
define that component. 

2. The key problems can AI abstract the math problems into a
fundamental data structure, for example, a directed graph (or other
structures).

1. Started to workon USBL since yesterday. Today work continues.
2. Neither cpgs/gpsmon is working at the beginning. After rebooting
the top, it started to work.
3. After connecting to 'usbltop' ad-hoc network, ssh to the TOP got
'connection refused'. Wait for 5 min and reconnect, it worked. If not,
reboot the TOP and wait for 5 min before reconnect.
4. Fish connects to Top's ad-hoc network upon booting. Setting up
Fish's ad-hoc connection is exactly the same way as setting up Top's
ad-hoc access point. The key is DO NOT USE NETPLAN. We should build a
new systemd service to setup the ad-hoc network. Simply follow Top's
setup procedure documented on github. Wasted me 3-4 hours.
5. colcon build 'py_usbl_top', 'py_usbl_fish', and 'usbl_interfaces'
in the working director of Top. Will move 'py_usbl_fish' to the Fish's
working directory and build again.

======
1. Wrote the steps to configure joining ad-hoc network in doc and
pushed to github. Also included my progress slides in the same github
respository.
2. Had the first robotics meeting in the morning 10am. The meeting
time will be switched to Monday 10am.
3. Happened to watch Magnus Carlson's youtube video analyzing the Game
between Elizabeth Harmon and Borgov from the Queen's Gambit. It's
surprising to me hat Magnus acknowledges that the movie presents many
game segments that he has never seen before. I come up with the idea
of discovering/generating game segments (through combinations,
probably) with AI tools and use it for teaching purpose.
4. I finished reading the first 3 chapters of the book 'Linear algebra
done right' and realized that vector is the data structure to store
information and matrix is just the tool for transforming vectors.

======
1. Fixed most of bugs that the current WearSlog v1.4 has. Tested.
2. Redesigned the state transition diagram. Will implement Slogger
v1.5 based this design.
