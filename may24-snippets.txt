1. The lake test on 05/05:
   - the ros2 bag file replay doesn't have /depth_sensing topic, but I
   did confirmed that the recording subscribed to this topic. Need to
   do air test to confirm.

2. The FISH stayed in the water for too short period of time, only a
few packets got transmitted to the TOP. Also, I need to re-tie the
fish and put more weight on the fish so that the sonar is always
pointing upright in the water. 

3. Connecting the TOP to internet through hotspot and push data to
server.
