======
1. Went to public health to wear 4 devices for free living test.
2. Went to Dr. Valtorta for advisement.
3. Need to finish Qiqi's paper work.
4. Understand the two-way-ranging paper.
5. Finish Glenn's work on re-align fitbit data.

05/03
======
1. Finished Qiqi's paper work.
2. Finished NIW research background/review.

05/06
======
1. The lake test on 05/05:
   - the ros2 bag file replay doesn't have /depth_sensing topic, but I
   did confirmed that the recording subscribed to this topic. Need to
   do air test to confirm.

2. The FISH stayed in the water for too short period of time, only a
few packets got transmitted to the TOP. Also, I need to re-tie the
fish and put more weight on the fish so that the sonar is always
pointing upright in the water. 

3. Connecting the TOP to internet through hotspot and push data to
server. 

05/25
======
1. Started to refactor Slogger to have both Wear/Tablet
version. Compiled first tablet version.

2. Will try to install Google Play Store on the Amazon Fire
tablet. Done installed google play store on the kindle fire, following
youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpTHGI8snt0 

3. Start to work on robotics, make sure we have /depth_sensing
topic. Need to test it in air.

05/27
======
1. Tested using ros2 bag recording /depth_sensing and replay. It worked.
2. Went to lake murray with Steve, but the recreation area was closed
because of memorial day traffic. We didn't do test.

05/28
======
1. Setup AWS server to accept message sent via hotspot from the lake.
2. It turned out that TOP/FISH couldn't connect to the hotspot at
booting, this might be because of the 5G configuraiton of this
hotspot. I should switch it to 2.4G and try again.
3. ros2 bag was recording the /depth_sensing properly.
4. Should write a message_processor for interpreting messages from
FISH ros2 topics. 
5. Should have a server that records all messages and plot all curves
automatically. 


05/29
======
1. The plot (depth vs time) generated from the TOP's received data
indicated data loss (or the code 'msg_processor' to recover
fragmented message is not working properly). But the plot from
USBLLONG indicated  many messgaes indeed were received. We need to
thoroughly investigate the msg_processor logic, and scrutinize the
partial message fragements to see what was happening during the
message recovering process. This also serves as the first step to
investigate data loss rate (vs. rssi). From the FISH side we know
how many data packages were sent, from the TOP side we know how many
data packages were received (should be correctly received, not because
of the faults of recovering algorithm).

05/30
======
1. The book "Understanding Deep Learning" seems to be a must read. The
github link is: https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/

2. Need to create a callback url (on aws server) for Withings App.
