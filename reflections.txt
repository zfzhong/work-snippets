1. Why was I late for 20 mintues for the 3:00 pm meeting?

* Being Late
---------------
The other day Ioannis was saying that in the US, if you are late for something, all people who are waiting for you might seriously consider it as being disrespectful.

Clearly, I am having a habit of being late. It's time to make a change, maybe.

I was telling myself that I had a meeting at 3pm. I never came up with the answer that I had to set out before 2:40pm. I needed 13 minutes to drive, and 7 minutes to find a parking spot.

But before that I needed to wash my hair and change clothings. I was meeting with Matt at 2:15pm to push code to the server. I found the android phone could not upload files to the server via https. I started to debug and wasted sometime there. My wife reminded me that I had to eat lunch at 2:40pm.

The whole morning I was working on robotics. I made some progress, but not to the extend I had expected. I tried to debug with the USBL modem until I found that the raspberry pi had to be connected to a monitor display. I didn't have a proper display at home.

Overall, I tried to finish things in about 5 hours, but it turned out these things requires 10 hours. I might be able to finish them in 5 hours if I was super focous and efficient. But the truth is that I am not always that focus. For example, I spent sometime read Strunk & White.

So why did I want to read Strunk & White in between my work. Because I wanted to have a break after I finished the Chrony setup with GPS. During that break I read a bit Strunk and White.


* The Right Answer
-------------------
Someone might come to tell me: don't read that damn thing and focus on your coding! My response would be: No. Reading that damn thing was the only joy out of the 5 hours' work.

The right answer is: having the right estimation for work.

If you dont estimate your work properly, you end up not finishing them in time and that will distory all your plan.

I thought about going to the office before 2pm and having meeting with Matt in the office. But when I received Matt's email, it's arleady 2:12pm and I still did not finish robotics work.

I could not finish my first piece of work by the time the second piece arrived. Any plan afterward would get ruined anway.


* The Root Cause & Remedy
------------------
The root cause of not estimating work properly is, as human being, we tend to over estimate ourselves. One common mistake is to use our best performance as regular performance.

How to fix this? Be ease to under estimate yourself.

Whenever someone ask you: can you get this done by next Monday? DONT RESPOND WITH YES/SURE/DEFINITELY.

One good answer is: I will try, I might need more time though.


* The Cost
------------------
The cost/problem is, when you don't give a firm answer, the other party might start to humiliate you by showing a death face or saying something like "oh, that I think is pretty easy, any undergrad with limit programming skill can finish it in 2 days". The situation might become complicated, difficult, and unpleasant.

And that's what usually happen in life.

But you really sholdn't lie to yourself for the purpose of making others happy.

The fact is, you can't control others. You want to be truthful to yourself and you always try your best, regardless whatever other people say or show.

You will become a better you anyway.
