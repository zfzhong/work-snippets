1. Slogger Tablet config menu partially working. Still need to write
params to config file and start logging.

2. Write Slogger user manual outline.

3. Figure out how to upload Slogger to google app store.

4. Read the papers sent by Glenn.

1. Kindle fire OS 8 (android 11, minSDK=30) won't support
setExactWhileIdle(), so I have to change the code to make it work on
the kindle fire tablet (also change sloggerlib). This will affect the
Slogger for Pixel 2 watches. The pixel watch Slogger would have
different code to work with SDK=31. 

2. Test slogger on Kindle fire OS for 10 min and transferred accel
data to server.

1. Slogger for Tablet got killed when launching other gaming apps
(while Slogger working in background with foreground service). It took
me hours to figure out that there is a "Game Mode" which should be
turned off when playing games on the kindle fire. In "Game Mode", all
other notifications will be killed, including the foreground service
notification.
