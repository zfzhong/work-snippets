1. Installed SloggerTablet on two Pixel Tablets. The Pixel Tablets has Android 14 system, which has specific requirement on two permission:
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC"/>

    I changed code to make it work. For BLE scan, we launch a scan every 20 seconds, and each scanning lasts for 10 seconds. We only record the scanned device if it has a deviceName (otherwise we ignore). This also requires change to the code on bufferedWriter.

1. Work on aws server database tables: UsblLong, RecvIms, FishData. The purpose is to upload all data to the server and generate figures on the server automatically.
2. We need to change the way to send sync packages to the Fish from the Top. We should use SENDIMS command.
3. We need to have the concept of 'experiment'. For each experiment, we have a specific series of figures to display.
4. Created a new msg structure under usbl_interfaces/UsblLong.msg, which is the exact message stucture as USBLLONG. The privious USBLFixRaw structure will not be used anymore. Need to rebuild this msg type tho.
5. upload data to server via different url.
6. GPS somehow is not working.
