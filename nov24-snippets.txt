1. Installed SloggerTablet on two Pixel Tablets. The Pixel Tablets has Android 14 system, which has specific requirement on two permission:
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC"/>

    I changed code to make it work. For BLE scan, we launch a scan every 20 seconds, and each scanning lasts for 10 seconds. We only record the scanned device if it has a deviceName (otherwise we ignore). This also requires change to the code on bufferedWriter.

======
1. Work on aws server database tables: UsblLong, RecvIms, FishData. The purpose is to upload all data to the server and generate figures on the server automatically.
2. We need to change the way to send sync packages to the Fish from the Top. We should use SENDIMS command.
3. We need to have the concept of 'experiment'. For each experiment, we have a specific series of figures to display.
4. Created a new msg structure under usbl_interfaces/UsblLong.msg, which is the exact message stucture as USBLLONG. The privious USBLFixRaw structure will not be used anymore. Need to rebuild this msg type tho.
5. upload data to server via different url.
6. GPS somehow is not working (probably need to do raspi-config)

======
1. Published Slogger App 1.6.3 to the Google Play Store. Somehow the signing key was missing from directory .../outputs/keys, I had to regenerate one, the keystore file is
/Users/zfz/workspace/slogger/app/build/outputs/keystorefileforsloggerapp1

2. Published SloggerTablet 1.6.3 to the Google Play Store, too.

3. Write python code to populate the USBLLONG database.

======
1. Generated plots using plotly for robotics data. Still, the FishData needs to be populated.
2. We need an expgroup design, so that an expgroup can have many  experiments (on that day). We would like to plot all figures for that expgroup on the same page.

======
1. While processing the FishData, I found that there's duplicated packets received (same seqNum from fish, different receiving time). We need to catch this error/duplication when write to db from the lake.
2. Displayed multiple figures in a signle webpage for the same exp group.
3. Website for robotics project done.

======
1. Spent the whole afternoon with Titon to print the mounting board for the Fish.
2. Created models for Kaleidomath: Source, MathTag, TagRelation, MathProblem.
3. Shooting practice with WZ, I found that he needs to change his shooting form (his left hand is block his right hand). He was reluctant to change.

11/12
======
1. Installed the mounting board, did some soldering, waiting for parts. Bought o rings.
2. Can't use the air decompresser to check the air tightness, coz some parts missing.
3. Write parser to parse all AMC8 Problems and populated db on server.
