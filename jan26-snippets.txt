2. Done generating Active Primary App Usage files (xxx_fau_usage.csv).

======
1. Integrate all procedures in Makefile. "make visual dir=path/to/data/file/directory"
2. Processed umich data and sent to umich professor.
3. The script will crash if there is a comma in the 'application_label', the remedy is to use pandas load csv file (right now, we read line by line from file). We need to do this change to make the script robust. And it's done.
4. We need to put all rows other than the 'app usage' rows into the final file, which is what the uzair scripts produce. Josh needs this. Done the major script. Need to write the 'run' script.
5. Our stack based algorithm can actually show how many apps are interacted with each other in a chain manner. This can be used to analyze the connections between Apps.
