1. Went to lake test for the day. Collected data at a new location. Need to specify the GPS locations on my map.
2. Fish tangled with the buoy lines. Should be more careful next time.
3. Communication somehow disconnected from the Top side. Tried to change the Top side source level and it didn't excute command from the server. Need to check the error.
4. The wave started to pickup and we had to leave the locaiton coz Alex had class in the afternoon.
5. It took us 25 minutes to navigate to the new location.
6. I need to develop a separate ros node to restart the Top and its services. Fish doesn't need this because we can mannually restart the Fish.

1. Srihari wants to add a new plot to the web: to show rssi/sourceLevel over distance. He also want me to add usbl multipath data report.
2. Srihari wants me to start another experiment with withings.
3. Srihari suggested having a configuration accessible from the webserver so that we can control the Slogger configuration of every device. We need to carefully design this. And we want to include a list of BLE devices to discover with BLE scan.

1. Got fever coz I did pullups without wearing much clothings after showering two days ago.
2. We need to redesign the way we parse data message for USBL top.
3. We should also control message transmitting rate (of the fish) from the server.

1. Withings data still has gap issue.
2. Got MITAMA and 8iVFBv2 datasets for the BVE project. Need to write code to sample each frame of the original data to get point cloud.
