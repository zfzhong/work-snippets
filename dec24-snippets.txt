======
1. Went to lake test for the day. Collected data at a new location. Need to specify the GPS locations on my map.
2. Fish tangled with the buoy lines. Should be more careful next time.
3. Communication somehow disconnected from the Top side. Tried to change the Top side source level and it didn't excute command from the server. Need to check the error.
4. The wave started to pickup and we had to leave the locaiton coz Alex had class in the afternoon.
5. It took us 25 minutes to navigate to the new location.
6. I need to develop a separate ros node to restart the Top and its services. Fish doesn't need this because we can mannually restart the Fish.
