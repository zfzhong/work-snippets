1. Fixed the unsigned 32-bit integer field for the exercise science project. Updated server and tested it. Thanks for the help from Matt to push code to the server.

2. Filled Andover MOAA forms for WZ to compete. Should prepare him for it somehow. Which date?

3. Finally get android app uploading local file to server working. Need to address details later.


* Reminder:
  1. I got a paper review due.
  2. Tell wz about the MOAA dates.
