1. Fixed the unsigned 32-bit integer field for the exercise science project. Updated server and tested it. Thanks for the help from Matt to push code to the server.

2. Filled Andover MOAA forms for WZ to compete. Should prepare him for it somehow. Which date?

3. Finally get android app uploading local file to server working. Need to address details later.

------------
1. Communication diagram for ROSNode <---> USBL.

2. Finished 4 items of the todo list of robotics: 1) no data transmission if the fish is not in water; 2) adjust source level based on RSSI; 3) initialized sync message from Top to Fish;

3. Sent Glenn ACG/HEART_RATE/GYRO log files extracted from the pixel watch.

4. I finished robotics class at 3:35 pm. There were only 5 people in the classroom (Monday 6 people).

5. Sent another set of ACC/ACG/HEART_RATE/GYRO data to Glenn.

6. Changed server code to add url to handle android files uploading.

------------
1. Start testing pixel watch for long logging hours. Probably will end in the afternoon 3:30pm.
2. Shoot email to Matt to schedule a 15min meeting to update the server.
3. I have an idea of reading "Element of Style by Strunk & White" and program them in Python and use the python code to check my writings. Maybe somebody already did this.
4. I should read Stunk & White for about 5 pages per day. It's a shame that I knew this book 20 years ago and I didn't read it thoroughly.
5. Server code updated, but https requersting is not working with the android app. Need to debug.
6. Finished one meet at 4:00pm, and another one at 5:30pm.
7. Srihari gave feedback to me on my presence at the 3:00pm - 4:00pm meeting. He gave me score 1 out of 10. Technically, I should say "I will address the details later", instead of saying "I will address that little details later". The main idea is: Think carefully, speak clearly without yelling any garbage.
8. I had reflection on being late.
9. It's 1:12am of Nov 6, I am not done with raspberry pi desktop installation yet. Have to stop here and come back tomorrow. I don't have wireless connection for the pi so i could only use my cell phone hotspot. The past three hours only spent on updating the ubuntu 22 system, and not successful. I should move the whole setup to Ioannis's lab. The only problem was i didn't want to carry the heavy equipment there. I have to go there tomorrow anyway, sigh.




* Reminder:
  1. I got a paper review due.
  2. robotics assignment (choose a topic)
