\chapter{Dreaming, Intelligence, and Generating Math Problems}
\begin{quotation}
  \emph{In dreams you see reality, sometimes.}
\end{quotation}

Upon awakening yesterday, I found myself contemplating the intricacies
of my brain's functioning. 

In my dream, I encountered individuals in my hometown preparing for a
fishing trip. Eager to join them, I expressed my interest, and they
agreed, proposing that I procure a large umbrella for sun protection
during our fishing expedition. I gladly accepted, recognizing the
minimal cost involved and the valuable experience of fishing with
them. 

Upon waking, I realized that the people from my dream were not actual
fishing enthusiasts in reality. However, the scenario of being asked
to buy an umbrella in exchange for a fishing opportunity mirrors
real-life occurrences. It appears that my brain crafted a narrative
about a fishing excursion with a group and transposed it onto
individuals who don't actually engage in fishing. This projection
maintains logical coherence in its central plot (buying an umbrella
for a fishing opportunity), despite the incongruity in the details
(these individuals don't fish in real life). 

It seems that the brain retains the underlying logic of a story and
later projects that logic onto a group of characters to generate
tangible scenes. This underlying logic serves as a summary of features
and logics from real-life experiences. It is a natural inference that
intelligence involves summarizing and extracting logic and features
from a broad spectrum of data. 

Transitioning to the Kaleidoscope project I am currently engaged in,
my goal is to create a generic model for a math problem and
subsequently generate various math problems based on the same model
but with different parameters. The challenge lies in defining this
generic model. Currently, I employ a table (or matrix) and projection
functions to construct the model, and this approach functions
adequately. 

The crux of the matter is how to autonomously and efficiently
summarize a math problem into this generic model with minimal manual
intervention. If we can achieve the autonomous summarization of a math
problem into a generic model and project the model onto various math
problems sharing the same underlying logic, we can attain a degree of
intelligence in both math problem creation and solving.
