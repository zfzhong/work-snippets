1. I moved all USBL devices to Ioannis' lab, hoping that he or someone
from the lab would help fix the washers. I was told that 'the washers
are too small and you can buy some larger ones at the ACE Hardware'. I
realized that I should take care of the problem by myself (instead of
waiting for someone to help). So I drove to the nearest ACE hardware
store and bought some larger washers. I actually took multiple washers
out of the store and tried them on the USBL device before I decided
which ones to buy. Anway, I am going to fix the washer problem today.

1. For last Friday's lake experiments, I had the following issues with
robotics:
  a) the TOP stopped working or reboot when we move it. Should try to
  replace the wire to see whether it fixes it.
  b) The TOP ros bag didnt record topic "USBL_Raw", the FISH ros bag
  didn't record "depth_sensing". Should write a script to handle the
  recording, instead of mannually type commands.
  c) when we pull the fish up from deep water, we pull it too fast and
  the rope squeezed the tube, sucking water inside to the tube. We
  should not tie the rope to the tube, we should tie it to the frame.
