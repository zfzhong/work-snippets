1. I moved all USBL devices to Ioannis' lab, hoping that he or someone
from the lab would help fix the washers. I was told that 'the washers
are too small and you can buy some larger ones at the ACE Hardware'. I
realized that I should take care of the problem by myself (instead of
waiting for someone to help). So I drove to the nearest ACE hardware
store and bought some larger washers. I actually took multiple washers
out of the store and tried them on the USBL device before I decided
which ones to buy. Anway, I am going to fix the washer problem today.

1. For last Friday's lake experiments, I had the following issues with
robotics:
  a) the TOP stopped working or reboot when we move it. Should try to
  replace the wire to see whether it fixes it.
  b) The TOP ros bag didnt record topic "USBL_Raw", the FISH ros bag
  didn't record "depth_sensing". Should write a script to handle the
  recording, instead of mannually type commands.
  c) when we pull the fish up from deep water, we pull it too fast and
  the rope squeezed the tube, sucking water inside to the tube. We
  should not tie the rope to the tube, we should tie it to the frame.

1. Artifact review for a Mobisys paper on face recognition using an
acoustic-based approach. I learned how to use codelab to run python
code with GPU. I even paid $10 for using the GPU. I should carefully
review the paper and code to learn signal processing and machine
learning. 

2. Review an mobicom paper on Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging. Learning
some fundamentals of the method. I should be able to use this method
in the underwater communication scenario (I doubt that it's
implemented in the USBL firmware, I should check the USBL's
implementation on detecting distance and angle, by triangulation?).

3. Figured out how to scan files with my printer. Basically, we can
scan to a USB drive.

4. Need to work on installing google play store on the kindle fire
pad.

5. Finished research background forms for NIW application.
