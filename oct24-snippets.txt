======
- Went to lake with battery bay and all other devices. The traffic was bad and it took us more than 1 hour to reach the lake. It's already 6:30pm. It's getting dark. We threw the USBL into water than realized that we never thought about how to place the battery bay. It shold be placed on top of the electronics bay and firmly fixed there. Anyway we took a underwater video with the GoPro that I had. The battery bay worked well. We just need to get it properly assembled.

- Had the robotics meeting at 9:30 and it ended around 10:50. The greek prof didn't ask me any questions. I tried to tell him we did some work on robotics and he seemed not interested and asked me to post my GoPro video on Slack.

- Went another meeting with mmWave prof and he suggested doing simulation (kind of ray tracking) first. He asked Reva to get code from Zhuang. I am not sure what work I should do. I asked Srihari, he is not sure, either. He sadi probably at this stage I shold also looked into the simulation code. I then asked Zhuang about this simulation code. He pointed me to the source of the code he got from. He said there is no real simulation, there is ray tracing though. I will look into the code and see what it does.

======
- Slept in the morning and wake up by fire alarms. My wife cooked something with microwave and the paper towel was burning. Firefighters came.

- Submitted USAMTS math solutions for william. Took me a long time to create github for him with his gmail and them draw graphs with asymptote.

- BLE integration with Slogger, the advertising part is working.

- BLE integration with Slogger, the Scan part is working, tested on both Pixel watch and Kindle Fire tablet. Two tasks to do: 1) UI to configure BLE mode: scan/advertise, and scan interval: 4/10/15 seconds. The preliminary design is: interval 4 seconds (2 seconds duration), interval 10 seconds (4 seconds duration), interval 20 seconds (6 seconds duration).  2) Log BLE scan data into files and upload the file to server.

======
- work on BEL logging files, so that the file can be uploaded to the server. Tested locally with https server (need to setup django with https).
- UI change done. Only configure BLE mode from UI. For SCAN mode, the scan interval is 10 seconds and scan duration is 2 seconds; for ADVERTISE mode, it's continuous advertising.
