======
- Went to lake with battery bay and all other devices. The traffic was bad and it took us more than 1 hour to reach the lake. It's already 6:30pm. It's getting dark. We threw the USBL into water than realized that we never thought about how to place the battery bay. It shold be placed on top of the electronics bay and firmly fixed there. Anyway we took a underwater video with the GoPro that I had. The battery bay worked well. We just need to get it properly assembled.

======
- Had the robotics meeting at 9:30 and it ended around 10:50. The greek prof didn't ask me any questions. I tried to tell him we did some work on robotics and he seemed not interested and asked me to post my GoPro video on Slack.

- Went another meeting with mmWave prof and he suggested doing simulation (kind of ray tracking) first. He asked Reva to get code from Zhuang. I am not sure what work I should do. I asked Srihari, he is not sure, either. He sadi probably at this stage I shold also looked into the simulation code. I then asked Zhuang about this simulation code. He pointed me to the source of the code he got from. He said there is no real simulation, there is ray tracing though. I will look into the code and see what it does.


10/17
======
- Slept in the morning and wake up by fire alarms. My wife cooked something with microwave and the paper towel was burning. Firefighters came.

- Submitted USAMTS math solutions for william. Took me a long time to create github for him with his gmail and them draw graphs with asymptote.

- BLE integration with Slogger, the advertising part is working.

- BLE integration with Slogger, the Scan part is working, tested on both Pixel watch and Kindle Fire tablet. Two tasks to do: 1) UI to configure BLE mode: scan/advertise, and scan interval: 4/10/15 seconds. The preliminary design is: interval 4 seconds (2 seconds duration), interval 10 seconds (4 seconds duration), interval 20 seconds (6 seconds duration).  2) Log BLE scan data into files and upload the file to server.

======
- work on BEL logging files, so that the file can be uploaded to the server. Tested locally with https server (need to setup django with https).
- UI change done. Only configure BLE mode from UI. For SCAN mode, the scan interval is 10 seconds and scan duration is 2 seconds; for ADVERTISE mode, it's continuous advertising.
- change the server code to handle BLE file uploading. Need to push the server code to producation (ask Matt).


10/22
======
- Meeting in the morning. Srihari said I should lookinto the ray tracing code. Sent email to Reza and got the code share by Zhuang.
- Changed Slogger wearable UI to configure BLE. Tested advertising locally.
- Should also change the file stats on Slogger wearable to show the number of BLE files.
- Need more test on Slogger wearable for BLE logging, since it creates files unexpectedly.
- Went for a lake test, partially successful. Alex and I met at 2:30pm, we did soldering for the battery bay since one wire broke unexpectedly. We started to prepare for the lake test by charging batteries, load devices to the car, and put the boat on top of my car. We couldn't find a proper rope to stablize the boat, etc. The preparation took us about 2 hours. It took us 40 minutes to drive to the lake. When we started the services for TOP/Fish, it worked well. GPS worked well, and changing of source level from webserver worked. However, Alex pulled the Fish out of water and the source level changed from 1 to 3 automatically (I asked him to pull the Fish out of water so that I can hear the loud noise when it's transmitting at source level 1. But I forgot that the Fish has a pressure sensor to detect its out of water and the transmitting will stop). Anyway, I need to investigate the source level change.
- Another bigger issue we had is we killed the ros2 nodes and moved devices to the center of lake. When I tried to ssh to the Top/Fish at the center of the lake, I couldn't reach them. It obvisous that the Fish/Top got disconnected from the hotspot. This was not what we expected. I need to investigate this, too.

10/29
======
- Unload all robotics devices from my car. I realized that the Fish tube has water inside. We should pull it slowly underwater, otherwise the pulling squeezes the tube and water will leak in. Fortunately the water was not too much and the electronics are working fine. I used my hair dryer to dry the electronics to get rid of the mist. The devices are heavy, unloading it self took more then 30 minutes.
- I then connect the battery bay and link it to my phone hotspot to copy the rosbag data. The Top electronics works fine. The Fish took a while to boot, I tried multiple ways and I finally copied the data from the Fish, too. Copying the data itself took me more than 1 hour.
- I checked the battery boat, it still has 97% of battery (surprise). The Fish battery is 19.8 (full was 21). That gave me an idea how quickly the battery was consumed during experiment.
- The data I copied from both Fish and Top are: ros bag files, and log files (~/.ros/log/xxxx.log).

- Had phone conversation with Srihari, he suggested me to organize data and generate plots in the following ways:
  1) Data: 1 file for data stream; 1 file for rssi stream; both are time series data.
  2) Merged file: 1 file for all. Columns: timestamp, depth, temperature, x, y, z, rssi, srclevel
  3) Plots:
     - x: distance; y: rssi (1 plot for al 4 source level, different colors)
     - x: distance; y: depth; z: rssi (4 plots; each one for a source level)

- During the lake test, I realized that the Fish might not get the message from Top to change source level to lower-level. In that case, the Top is transmitting at a lower source level while the Fish is still transmistting at a higher source level. Unfortunately, the message sent the the server doesn't include the source level information. Ideally, the message sent to the server should include both depth and source level information (for both the Top and the Fish).
- Basically, we need to have a good understanding of the Top/Fish's behavior in the current stage. For example, how the responde to source level change? Can the two devices send messages to each other with different source levels at the same time. What's the mechanism to discover the source level that the sender is using upon receiving messages.
- Other questions: what is the package loss rate? retransmitting count on average? I realized that sometime we can't decode the messages from the content read from socket, or we only decode partial messages. Is that because of packet loss? We need to further investigate the data decoding mechanism.

- After checking the data and code, it seems that the Fish never adjust its source level (always 3). One possibility is that it implicitly changed its source level upon receiving the message from the Top, because we indeed heard the noise which was much louder. So we might need to explicitly check the source level of the Modem. The way to log source level should be redesigned: we should log the source level in the same way as we log the battery level.
