Deraming, Intelligence, and Generating Math Problems

Yesterday I woke up from dreaming and I started to think how my brain
works.

In my dream I met some people in my hometwon and they were about to go
fishing somewhere. I requested to join them. They generally agreed and
then asked me to buy a big umbrella so that we can shelter the sun
while fishing. I happily agreed, since buying an umbrealla won't cost
much and the experience of going fishing with them would be valuable
for me.

When I woke up, I realized that in reality these people I met in my
dream never go fishing. But the action that they asked me for buying
an umbrella in exchange of taking me to fishing is what usually happen
in real life. It is like that my brain had a story about me going
fishing with a group of people and being asked to buy an unbrella, but
the brain projected this story to a group of people who don't really
fish in real life. This projection seems quite reasonable on its major
plot (buying an umbrella in exchange of fishing opportunity), despite
the minor defect (these people don't fish in real life). 

It seems that the brain keeps the underlying logic of a story, and
later projects that logic to a group of charaters to generate the
actual scenes. That underlying logic is the summary of features/logics
of scenes I experienced in real life. It is natural to conclude that
intelligence is to summarize/extract logic/features from a wide range
of data.

Come to the Kaleidoscope project that I am working on, I want to
create a generic model for a math problem and later generate different
math problems based on the same model but with different
parameters. The problem is how to define that generic model. Right now
I use a table (or called matrix) and projection functions to form this
model. This works okay.

The key problem is how to summarize a math
problem into that generic model in a automatical (or efficient) way
with minimum mannual work. If we can summarize a math problem in to a
genric model in a autonomous way, and project the model back to many
different math problem that share the same underlying logic, we then
achieve some intelligence in math problem creation and solving.

Dreaming, Intelligence, and Generating Math Problems

Upon awakening yesterday, I found myself contemplating the intricacies
of my brain's functioning. 

In my dream, I encountered individuals in my hometown preparing for a
fishing trip. Eager to join them, I expressed my interest, and they
agreed, proposing that I procure a large umbrella for sun protection
during our fishing expedition. I gladly accepted, recognizing the
minimal cost involved and the valuable experience of fishing with
them. 

Upon waking, I realized that the people from my dream were not actual
fishing enthusiasts in reality. However, the scenario of being asked
to buy an umbrella in exchange for a fishing opportunity mirrors
real-life occurrences. It appears that my brain crafted a narrative
about a fishing excursion with a group and transposed it onto
individuals who don't actually engage in fishing. This projection
maintains logical coherence in its central plot (buying an umbrella
for a fishing opportunity), despite the incongruity in the details
(these individuals don't fish in real life). 

It seems that the brain retains the underlying logic of a story and
later projects that logic onto a group of characters to generate
tangible scenes. This underlying logic serves as a summary of features
and logics from real-life experiences. It is a natural inference that
intelligence involves summarizing and extracting logic and features
from a broad spectrum of data. 

Transitioning to the Kaleidoscope project I am currently engaged in,
my goal is to create a generic model for a math problem and
subsequently generate various math problems based on the same model
but with different parameters. The challenge lies in defining this
generic model. Currently, I employ a table (or matrix) and projection
functions to construct the model, and this approach functions
adequately. 

The crux of the matter is how to autonomously and efficiently
summarize a math problem into this generic model with minimal manual
intervention. If we can achieve the autonomous summarization of a math
problem into a generic model and project the model onto various math
problems sharing the same underlying logic, we can attain a degree of
intelligence in both math problem creation and solving.
