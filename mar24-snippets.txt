1. Consolidated Fish depth, Fish GPS, Top GPS, rssi, USBL reported
distance into a single plot.
2. Need to work on TOP GPS Node to dump data into a topic; and test.
3. Need to work on IMS for sync packet and do air test.
4. Need to schedule Lake test (deep water for Top); designed tests:
a) Test1: Vary fish's depth and compare real depth and reported
distance. In this experiment, Top and Fish should locate at the same
spot on the lake, while Fish vertically drop to the deep water and
move back.
b) Fix the Top above deep water (with anchor in the lake), and
navigate the Fish away from the Top.
c) Definitely need fish finder to scan the bottom of the lake to avoid
obstacles (so that the Fish won't be tangled).

5. Need to work on web server to plot heart rate.
