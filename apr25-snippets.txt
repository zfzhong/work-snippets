1. Redesigned the logic of initializing sensors (gyro/accel): if it's App, init wakeup sensors; if it's Tablet, init normal sensors. This is realized by using the isWearable variable in ConfigParams. Changed the code, tested, and installed on 3 Tablets and 2 watches for Olivia (local installation).
2. Note that the Tablet has no wakeup sensors. The App will crash if try to init wakeup sensors.
3. The design for logging BLE scan data: After the scan ends, the log file closes, no more scanned records will be written into the log file.

1. It turned out that the Pixel Tablet has Android 14 (SDK 34) and it requires extra permission to do BLE scan in the background:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION" />
And I need to do extra handling to get permissions, since the Slogger Tablet also target Kindle Fire devices which have SDK 31.
2. Fixed the issue and move the Slogger version to 1.6.4. So now, the Slogger can do BLE scan using the foreground service:
a) if the user is playing another App, and the Slogger can run in the background (with foreground service) to do BLE scan;
b) if the user turn the tablet screen to dark (inactive), then no BLE scan (but still has accel/gyro).
