2/1
======
1. William did well in mathcount. He wont 3rd place in the countdown round. He was the top 16. His team won the first place (I suspect that he was the weakest of the 4 boys in his team).
2. The preparation works. We did mathcount problems every night for 5 days. The Friday night we did mock test and came up with a strategy: 1) finsih 10 problems in the first 10 min; 2) Finish the 10-15 problems in another 10 min;  and 3) finish the 15-20 problems the next 10 min; overall, we finish the first 20 problems in 30 min; and the rest 20 min, we attach the 21-30 problems. No matter how many we get it right for the 21-30 problems, we will have a good score coz we did the first 20 problems well.

1. William was upset coz he attended a basketball event during 1pm-3pm, and then he was scheduled for a basketball training from 3pm - 5pm. He refused to get off the car until we had a long conversation with him. He finally wento the training at 4:30pm. He spent 30 minutes training before coach O wrapped it up at 5pm.
2. William started to shoot 3-pointers with correct footwork. His body is much more stable than before: 1,2, rise and shoot.
3. Tina learned new move to shoot 3-pointer: pump fake, drive, heavy corss (peek the ring), step back and shoot (follow through high).
4. Uncle left to work today (he spent 4 days with us, he purchased a new iphone and got a phone number, i can call him now).
5. William negotiated with me for getting his PS5 back, I refused to give it back and told him the reason. He was testing me. I said i will see his behave this week and then decide. He said that I should tell him before I took his PS5 away.


2/3
======
1. Work with Candy to get python script working to process W4E data. Several changes made to the script: a) the master tracking sheet was hard coded, candy wants to read a different master tracking sheet in the w4e directory. we have to make change in the code to specify the new path to the master tracking sheet; b) for PA protocol, the code will process fitabase data at the end (aggregation), and it complains if no fitabase data exists. We made change to this part: if there is no fitabase file, the code wont do aggregation for fitbabase.

2/5
======
1. Opened the electronic bay (the metal box) and found water inside. I forgot the wifi logic: the Top/Fish automatically connects to wifi hotspot 'usbltop' if exists. After a bit research, I realized that the GPS data reported by the adafruit gps should be converted to 'decimal' before we can use it to get location on google map. I need to write a conversion code for it.
2. William did 20 mins math before doing anything in the evening. He felt good about it. I will try to make sure he does math first on a daily basis, otherwise he wont be willing to do it in the late night.

2/16
======
1. Finished uploading all AMC10 problems (2000-2024) to production.
