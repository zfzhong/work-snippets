2/1
======
1. William did well in mathcount. He wont 3rd place in the countdown round. He was the top 16. His team won the first place (I suspect that he was the weakest of the 4 boys in his team).
2. The preparation works. We did mathcount problems every night for 5 days. The Friday night we did mock test and came up with a strategy: 1) finsih 10 problems in the first 10 min; 2) Finish the 10-15 problems in another 10 min;  and 3) finish the 15-20 problems the next 10 min; overall, we finish the first 20 problems in 30 min; and the rest 20 min, we attach the 21-30 problems. No matter how many we get it right for the 21-30 problems, we will have a good score coz we did the first 20 problems well.

1. William was upset coz he attended a basketball event during 1pm-3pm, and then he was scheduled for a basketball training from 3pm - 5pm. He refused to get off the car until we had a long conversation with him. He finally wento the training at 4:30pm. He spent 30 minutes training before coach O wrapped it up at 5pm.
2. William started to shoot 3-pointers with correct footwork. His body is much more stable than before: 1,2, rise and shoot.
3. Tina learned new move to shoot 3-pointer: pump fake, drive, heavy corss (peek the ring), step back and shoot (follow through high).
4. Uncle left to work today (he spent 4 days with us, he purchased a new iphone and got a phone number, i can call him now).
5. William negotiated with me for getting his PS5 back, I refused to give it back and told him the reason. He was testing me. I said i will see his behave this week and then decide. He said that I should tell him before I took his PS5 away.
