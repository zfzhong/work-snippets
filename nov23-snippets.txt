------------
1. Robotics meeting: reported Fadel's work on underwater backscatter
communication and Ioannis didn't give a dime on it. Then I switch to
report that Ubuntu 22 doesn't support Raspberry Pi 5 and ROS2 only
works on Ubuntu 22 and I had to order 2 Raspberry Pi 4 boards
yesterday (will arrive on Thursday). Remanucaturing Fish will be
done since Titon already 3D-printed the holder.

2. It turned out that the WearSlog doesn't need ambient mode, we just
have to keep the app ALWAYS_ON. There is a flag in the code to set:
FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON.

3. Tested WearSlog for 30 minutes and found out the sorting of files
was based on string comparision; re-coded the sorting based on
comparison of file numbers and tested, and it's working. Realized that
the accelerometer changed sampling rate from 50Hz to 100Hz during the
logging. The first 65 files are logged at 50Hz, and the rest of over
100 files are logged at 100Hz. This is just weird.



* Reminder:
  1. robotics presentation review
  1. robotics assignment (due oct 30)
