1. Robotics meeting: reported Fadel's work on underwater backscatter
communication and Ioannis didn't give a dime on it. Then I switch to
report that Ubuntu 22 doesn't support Raspberry Pi 5 and ROS2 only
works on Ubuntu 22 and I had to order 2 Raspberry Pi 4 boards
yesterday (will arrive on Thursday). Remanucaturing Fish will be
done since Titon already 3D-printed the holder.

2. It turned out that the WearSlog doesn't need ambient mode, we just
have to keep the app ALWAYS_ON. There is a flag in the code to set:
FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON.

3. Tested WearSlog for 30 minutes and found out the sorting of files
was based on string comparision; re-coded the sorting based on
comparison of file numbers and tested, and it's working. Realized that
the accelerometer changed sampling rate from 50Hz to 100Hz during the
logging. The first 65 files are logged at 50Hz, and the rest of over
100 files are logged at 100Hz. This is just weird.

4. Found out the sampling frequency change was due to the fact that
other Apps that use accelerometer might set it to 100Hz.

5. Did underwater communication bib research, wil finish tomorrow.

1. Check log file and found that WearSlog stopped in the morning
around 4:30am, it lasted about 7.5 hours and ran out of battery. So
letting screen on is a bad idea.
2. Tried to log onPause/onResume events when the screen goes
off. Looks like accelerometer has data when screen goes off but hear
rate sensor stopped report data. Need backgorund sensor service.
3. Tried PassiveData app and it didn't work so well since I dont know
how frequently it should report the data, and the data is claimed to
be reported in batch while PassiveData only records the latest one.
4. Gathered all research papers for underwater communication, need to
write the report.
5. Raspberry Pi 4 arrived.

11/03/2023
-----------
1. Regular teaching and assignment work (6:00am - 9:00am).
2. Attended seminar.
3. Teaching from 9:00pm - 12:00am.

-----------
1. Submitted assignment 1 for robotics class (delayed 1 week).
2. Start to read  FAB-MAP paper: the Chow-Liu Tree seems interesting,
I should know how it works.

1. The plan is get pix2pix original code working with GPU on the dell
laptop, and train the pix2pix model for audio data using two saparate
matrices (one for frequency, one for phase).
2. On dell laptop, enter WSL system, the conda env doesn't work well
with GPU. 'conda deactivate', then the system default env works with
GPU. Potentially because the system has GPU driver installed by
default. Anyway, will figure out the enviroment issues later. Ideally,
we should have a virtual env with GPU working.
3. I want to figure out how much the phase affects the quality of the
audio with sampling frequency above 40k Hz (right now we are using a
frequency of 12k Hz). I should get some audio samples and feed them
into the inverse spectrogram code pipleline (gen spectrogram, only get
the norm of the Fourier coefficients, and reverse back to audio) and
see how it works.
4. During meeting, sanjib pointed out that the mistake i had in my
code last time was that I used the absolute value of the input audio
signal, not the absoluate value of the FFT result. He said that that
phase info in the FFT result should account for about 50% of the info.


* Reminder:
  1. robotics presentation review
  2. Robotics presentation (nov 13)
  3. robotics assignment 2 (calibration of camera, due nov 15)
