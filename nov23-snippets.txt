1. Robotics meeting: reported Fadel's work on underwater backscatter
communication and Ioannis didn't give a dime on it. Then I switch to
report that Ubuntu 22 doesn't support Raspberry Pi 5 and ROS2 only
works on Ubuntu 22 and I had to order 2 Raspberry Pi 4 boards
yesterday (will arrive on Thursday). Remanucaturing Fish will be
done since Titon already 3D-printed the holder.

2. It turned out that the WearSlog doesn't need ambient mode, we just
have to keep the app ALWAYS_ON. There is a flag in the code to set:
FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON.

3. Tested WearSlog for 30 minutes and found out the sorting of files
was based on string comparision; re-coded the sorting based on
comparison of file numbers and tested, and it's working. Realized that
the accelerometer changed sampling rate from 50Hz to 100Hz during the
logging. The first 65 files are logged at 50Hz, and the rest of over
100 files are logged at 100Hz. This is just weird.

4. Found out the sampling frequency change was due to the fact that
other Apps that use accelerometer might set it to 100Hz.

5. Did underwater communication bib research, wil finish tomorrow.

------------
1. Check log file and found that WearSlog stopped in the morning
around 4:30am, it lasted about 7.5 hours and ran out of battery. So
letting screen on is a bad idea.
2. Tried to log onPause/onResume events when the screen goes
off. Looks like accelerometer has data when screen goes off but hear
rate sensor stopped report data. Need backgorund sensor service.
3. Tried PassiveData app and it didn't work so well since I dont know
how frequently it should report the data, and the data is claimed to
be reported in batch while PassiveData only records the latest one.
4. Gathered all research papers for underwater communication, need to
write the report.
5. Raspberry Pi 4 arrived.

11/03/2023
-----------
1. Regular teaching and assignment work (6:00am - 9:00am).
2. Attended seminar.
3. Teaching from 9:00pm - 12:00am.

11/05/2023
-----------
1. Submitted assignment 1 for robotics class (delayed 1 week).
2. Start to read  FAB-MAP paper: the Chow-Liu Tree seems interesting,
I should know how it works.

1. The plan is get pix2pix original code working with GPU on the dell
laptop, and train the pix2pix model for audio data using two saparate
matrices (one for frequency, one for phase).
2. On dell laptop, enter WSL system, the conda env doesn't work well
with GPU. 'conda deactivate', then the system default env works with
GPU. Potentially because the system has GPU driver installed by
default. Anyway, will figure out the enviroment issues later. Ideally,
we should have a virtual env with GPU working.
3. I want to figure out how much the phase affects the quality of the
audio with sampling frequency above 40k Hz (right now we are using a
frequency of 12k Hz). I should get some audio samples and feed them
into the inverse spectrogram code pipleline (gen spectrogram, only get
the norm of the Fourier coefficients, and reverse back to audio) and
see how it works.
4. During meeting, sanjib pointed out that the mistake i had in my
code last time was that I used the absolute value of the input audio
signal, not the absoluate value of the FFT result. He said that that
phase info in the FFT result should account for about 50% of the info.
5. Nice to find the quarternion algebra basics introduced in 'Indirect
Kalman Filter for 3D Attitude Estimation'[1]. I also found some other
useful docs for understanding quarternions[2,3].
6. To understand quarternions, i have to understand 3D rotation groups
first. 
7. I gotta to re-learn symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices. Oh, I
got it: A = A' (A_{ij} = A_{ji}, symmetric), A = -A' (A_{ij} =
-A_{ji}, skew-symmetric).
8. Quaternion and Euler parameters stated clearly in [8].
9. And it's good to know that vector dot product is to 1) project a
vector to another vector and 2) multiple their magnitudes to get a
scalar (u\dot v = |u|\times|v|\times cos\theta).

1. Now I got a better understanding of the Euler Parameters and
Quaternions. The Nikravesh's book is very helpful. I also know what
vector cross product is (I probably learned this in UT Austin
before). I definitely show spend some time to to redraw the figure 6.5
and reason the steps to get e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3 for quarternions.
2. Quaternion is NOT quarter-nion. I now know that rotation is matrix
conjugation: q * u * conj(q). I need to get the matrix algebra done
thoughly on mind.
3. Installed raspberry pi 4, installed ros2 on top.

1. On the way home I realized that I messed up the ip address of eth0
and the ip address of modem, and that's why I couldn't ping the
modem. I just fixed it this morning and now the modems are working
fine. I need to write down all the steps to setup the environment for
modems + sensors (imu+gps) + ros2.
2. robotics meeting: ioannis is asking me document everything and put
code into github repo. I created the repo and started writing README:
https://github.com/zfzhong/underwater-usbl-comm#hareware-devices-for-the-fish
3. Installed ROS2 on both Top/Fish. Should double check ros-dev-tools
gets installed on Top. 
4. During the robotics class, Titon was continuing his presentation on
paper[1]. I figured out how the quaternion derivative was done
(basically it's the derivative of \theta over t -> \omega). Because
quaternion is a function of \theta, and the derivative over t is the
angular velocity \omega.
5. WZ attended AMC10 at Dreher High and he did 8 problems. He shared
one problem with me and it turned out he did it wrong. I was happy that
he treated it seriously. Anna told me that he was eager to see me
before the test started. I felt a lot of responsbilities.


11/09/2023
-----------
1. I am working on the matrix algebra part of the quaternion, I am
getting the L(q) and R(q) and skew-symmetric matrix.
2. Working on foreground service for WearSlog. Got the foreground
service working and now the sensors' data gets logged into files in
despite the screen goes off. It works even when I manually lock the
screen with passcode. Will test it overnight to see how the logging
data looks like. I will version it WearSlog v1.1. 
3. WZ turned 13. I bought a macbook air M2 for him. He should start
programming sooner or later.


11/10/2023
-----------
1. Test WearSlog v1.1 for several trials: 1) The watch got unlocked
somehow (I had passcode set) ... strange; 2) Only heart rate sensor
was working; 3) Set foreground service when click; 4) Enabled 3
sensors and test again.

1. Now I realized that the 'cross product' only applies to vectors in
R3 and R7. I thought it was a general operation for vectors in linear
algebra, but it turned out not. And I realized that Hamilton defined
it for quaternion. A good discussion for the cross product for R3 and
R7 is in this paper[9] published in 1983.
